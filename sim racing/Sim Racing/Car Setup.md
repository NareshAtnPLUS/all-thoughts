Before setting up the car, i need to know the  basic characteritics of the car. I like to drive these cars
- [[Mercedes AMG GT3]]
- [[BMW M4 GT3]]
- [[Audi R8 GT3]]
car setup is split into 6 sections
1. [[Tyres]]
2. [[Electronics]]
3. [[Fuel and Strategy]]
4. [[Mechanical Grip]]
5. [[Dampers]]
6. [[Aero]]

## Important Notes
### Toe
- Positive values toe in which is increased stability
- Negative values are toe out which is increased responsiveness
to make a car responsive using toe, we need to do the following
- Increase toe-out in the front ( provide more negative toe values )
- Decrease toe-in in the rear ( provide lesser positive toe values )

If the car understeers when turning in then the front toe out is not good enough

If the car understeers during the exit of the corner, then rear toe in more, try reducing the toe in values ( provide less positive values )

Generally we don't make toe out configuration in the rear which makes the car less stable and loose traction in the rear


Overall for more stability, increase toe in values (more positive toe values)
for more responsiveness, increase toe out values ( more negative toe values)

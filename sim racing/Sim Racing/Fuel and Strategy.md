Fuel strategy is all the about pit stops
#### Key points to remember on fuel strategy
- use 15L for a qualifying session
- use 60L for a half hour race
- use 120L for longer races
- Brake Compounds
	1. Shorter and Quali sessions Best Braking Performance
	2. Endurance Pads - Longer 
	3. Wet Weather Pads
### Grain Blister and Flat spots
Graining is strips of rubber torn out of tyre from the heavy use but instantly stuck back into the tyre because of heat, creating uneven surface, which will create under-steer

Blisters are caused by over heating and fly off the tyres, this time creating a broken up surface, fix this issue by finding out what is creating the problem and fix the issue at the source

Flatspots are caused by lockups, limited by ABS


### Pad Wear and Disc Wear
29.00 mm is an unused pad, while 32.00 mm is a new brake disc, when the pad wear is near half of the original depth, they are getting close to a change.


## Pit Stop Strategy
N Pitstops means a pit stop preset
during a pit stop 
- tyre set, compound, and its pressures can be changed
- brake pads and fuels can also be changed
All of this can be adjusted in the pitstop pad

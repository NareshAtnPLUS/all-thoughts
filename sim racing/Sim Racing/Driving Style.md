Driving style is the pattern which an individual likes to adapt himself to go around the corner which is efficient for the individual.

Every driver has his own way or preferences, expectations from the car to do in an corner.

How i like my car to be around the corner, there are three sections to analyse 
- Corner Entry
- Mid Corner
- Corner Exit
#### Corner Entry
During this phase, i like to keep the car more stable and well positioned as possible, to go into the next phase of the corner which is the meat part of the corner, i can compromise on lower minimum speed around the corner. 
I want the car to load up the front so that the front can have more mechanical grip to make maximum rotation as possible during the mid corner.


#### Mid Corner
During this phase, i like to turn as quickly as possible, pivot the car towards the corner exit, keep the trajectory focused on the corner exit. For me the mid corner car should have maximum grip on the front to rotate the car well into the corner exit. I don't like the car to be under-steering at this phase. I expect the car to be oversteery at this phase, 

#### Corner Exit 
During this phase i want the car support the massive acceleration, 


I need to learn how to keep the car stable on corner entry, pivot the car in the corner exit direction, shoot out in a controlled manner, 

I have to feel the car more 


- [!] Immediate steps to improve the driving style.
- [ ] Feel the car's understeer and oversteer and note it down
	- [ ] Set the correct toe, camber and anti rollbar settings
- [ ] Study why 
	- [ ] understeer happens
	- [ ] oversteer happens
- [ ] Drive 50 Consistent Laps around the track, During this phase
	- [ ] Do not push the car to its limits
	- [ ] 
- [ ] Analyze how the grip of the car changes in 
	- [ ] accleration
	- [ ] braking
	- [ ] steering

## Tyre Pressures
Tyre pressurse affects how much air in the tyres, therefore affects how much tyre is touch the ground at any given moment. 
#### Contact Patch 
The area of the tyre touching the ground is called contact patch,
So the *softer tyre* can give me a larger contact patch, therefore produces more heat and more vulnerable to wear, 
*harder tyre* creates less friction on a smaller contact patch 

### Optimum hot Running Pressures for GT3s
1. Dry - 27.3 - 27.8 psi
2. Wet - 29.5 to 31.0 psi



## Suspension Geometry
### Toe 
Toe is the angle to point the wheel towards or away from the car
+ve values are toe in
-ve values are toe out

#### Key points
- Having more *toe in*  provides more stability and potentially make the car understeer bit more, the front of the car doesn't turn as much as i want it to. 
- having more *toe out* provide more twitchy car and making it oversteer at the front bit more, the front of the car will be more responsive
- Avoid toe out configuration at the rear. as it makes the car more oversteery and loose at the rear end.
- Go focus on how much *toe in* to be given in the rear of the car.

### Camber
Camber is the angle of the tyres in terms of which way they lean from the center of the car,
race cars generally suit negative camber, during cornering, we apply increased load towards the outside tyre, by applying this load the negative camber will become neutral and increase the contact patch around the outside tyre, providing traction
#### Key points
- Too much negative camber less of the tyre will be contact with the road as i head onto the straight as the car flattens out, this could cause me loose traction on the straight line, potentially making me lose laptimes, also making me slower slower around the corners, giving me less grip under heavy or straight line braking
### Last Readings
Make Suspension Geometry Changes based on last readings or data 
IMO - Inside Middle Outside
this temperature readings can help me make the camber adjustments
#### Key Points for Camber
- the spread of temperatures across IMO can be influenced by the angle of cambers
- In general i want a reasonably consistent spread of temperature from IMO also naturally the inside of the tyre is hotter.
- if the inside part of the tyres is much higher, it would suggest that too much load is going through this part of the tyre - *make the negative camber less extreme*
- if the outside part of the tyre is much higher, the camber is not enough, it have to reduced a bit more
#### Key points for wear rate
- the number indicates the mm of thread depth remaining, it starts at 3mm and ends at 1.5 
- if the wear rate goes down at faster rate than my rivals, that means i'm hard on my tyres
- so i might need adjust my driving style or setup
### Caster
it affects the angle of front suspension, it affects the way the steering feels
#### Key points
- lowering this number makes the steering wheel lighter and also decreases the speed in which the steering wheel recenters itself

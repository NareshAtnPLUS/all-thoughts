I have already built a pc spec, i have to understand the liquid cooling and incorporate some of the liquid cooling and build a more cooled and optimum pc for racing
Look at how to build a proper liquid cooling pc

check how many fans come with liquid cooler and how many fans come with cabinet
for nzxt and corsair


chasis design is important so choose a chasis with these points are important
1. Cooling is the first priority
2. should be compatible with 360mm liquid cooler
3. intake fans = exhaust fans in the cabinet

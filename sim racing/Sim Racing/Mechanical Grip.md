There are Eight different settings here which i can change which will all affect to the mechanical grip of the car in different ways
1. Anti Roll bar
2. Brake Bias 
3. Steer ratio
4. Differential
5. Wheel rates
6. Bump stops

## 1. Anti Roll bar
This is a bar connecting left and right suspension to one another in order to try and limit the chassis roll, adjusting the Anti Roll bar mainly affect under steer and over steer. 

### Key Points for Anti Roll bar
- Increasing the ARB - stiffening it 
- Decreasing the ARB - softening it 
- By Stiffening the ARB, I'm limiting the chassis roll
- By Softening the ARB, I'm allowing the car to lean more
##### Front Anti Roll bar
1. **Front ARB** affects how the car behaves going into the corner or **corner entry**
2. *Stiffer ARB* will create more *understeer* on turning, while 
3. *Softer ARB* will give me more front grip to turn the car, creating more *oversteer*.
##### Rear Anti Roll bar
1. **Rear ARB** affects how the car behaves on **corner exit**, rear anti rollbar characteristics are opposite to front anti rollbar
2. Having a stiffer anti rollbar at the rear will provide less grip, which will create *oversteer*
3. Having a softer  anti rollbar at the rear will provide more grip, which will create *understeer*

## 2. Brake Bias
Braking power distribution between front and rear. the number always mentions how much braking power is sent to the front of the car

### Key Points for brake bias
1. Increased brake bias provides more stable braking performance, but may cause to understeer at the corner entry
2. Decreased brake bias provides more effective but less stable braking performance, causes oversteer when turning into the corner
3. Brake bias can be altered during driving for the sequence of corners to influence the balance between understeer and oversteer

## 3. Steer Ratio
Steer ratio represents the relationship between steering wheel and the actual wheel in terms of rotation, higher steer ration means slower steering. make this changes with the steering wheel settings from logitech

## 4. Differential
system which allows each individual wheel to rotate in a different speed rather than at the same speed
- Closed Diff means the torque is distributed more evenly across each tyre
- Open Diff means more torque is sent to least resistence
- Left is opening up the diff
- Right is closing up the diff
### Key points for Diff
1. *Lower preload* diff provides more *agile car* when **turn in** and *more traction* on **corner exit**, the expense of ***mid corner understeer***
2. *Higher preload* diff provides more *stable car* when **turn in** and *less traction* on **corner exit**Higher preload and some ***mid corner over steer***

## 5. Wheel rates 
Wheel rate effectively refers amount of pressure needed to compress the suspension spring. The spring requiring *more pressure* could also be described as *stiffer spring*. Right to increase the stiffness
### Key points for wheel rates or suspension
- Generally, the stiffer front suspension makes the car more planted and easy to point spring
- Softer front suspension makes the car turn more or rotate easier
- Rear stiffer suspension makes the car slide more, then soften up a little bit
- When the car is bumpy i need softer suspension setup
- Generally stiffer suspensions are preferred
- It also highly dependent on other factors such as ride height, dampers and aero adjustments
## 6. bump stops
This affects the stiffness of the suspension, bumpstops are effectively blocks the rubber, designed to stop the damper bottoming out
### Key points for bumpstops
1. Increasing the bumpstops rate increases the  firmness of the bumpstop effectively increases the stiffness of the compression
2. Decreasing this bumpstop rate decreases the firmness of the bumpstop effectively the compression of the stiffness is softer
3. Bumpstop range affects the thickness or height of the bumpstop which in turn affects amount of room that the spring has to compress before it hits the bumpstop

### Key points for Wheel rate and Bumpstops
- Yellow line start of the suspension, which is related to the wheel range
- Red line start of the bumpstop, which is related to the bumpstop range
- if i increase the bumpstop range by clicking right, i increase the gap between two lines
- the smaller the gap between two lines the smaller the window is for the spring to compress and therefore stiffer the suspension becomes
- Generally, GT3 cars like having these two lines close to each other, because it creates a stiff suspension
- but it i'm trying to rotate the car around the corner and the outside tyre is being held back by the bump stop if it hits too early, i may need to increase the window, which makes the suspension softer and provides more grip
- Generally, the bumpstop range is much larger in the rear than at the front because this aids traction out of corners

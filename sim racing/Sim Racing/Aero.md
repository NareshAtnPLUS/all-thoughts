## 1. Fuel Load Test
this will help me simulate the ride height of the car, when the fuel is burned of from the tank. 

## 2. Ride Height
It indicates the how many mm between there are between the ground and the underside of the car. 
I can change the front and rear ride height independantly
generally, racing cars prefers lower ride height of the car
having a low center of gravity make the car more stable through the corners and create less body movements
there are also two reasons why we dont make lower ride heights possible 
1. i dont want to make the car to bottom out and hit the circuit, especially mid corner
2. Its not just about the overall height of the car, its about balance of the height from front to back 
### High rake philosophy
Lowering the front ride height and increasing the rear ride height will change the angle of the car, forcing more air to push the front of the car into the ground, giving you more grip at the front and less grip at the rear, this will you give me sharper turn in but it can cause oversteer and also loose some straight line performance

### Lower rake philosophy
Decreasing the rear ride height provide more stable car and bit understeery car, gives me less turning ability but stable rear end

## 3. Rear wing
this is another way of influencing the aero dynamics of the car
## 4. Front to rear aero variation
this is the aero balance between front and rear of the car and is measured in %. 
+ve values denote the car is front aero heavy, which means better turning and more oversteer and less rear end stability
-ve values denotes the car is rear aero heavy, more understeer, less turn in and more stable backend


+ve values oversteer
-ve values understeer

use aero variation number to achieve the same balance with different elements altered

Damper is another word for shock absorber, the job of the damper is to control the energy that goes through the suspension.
Changing damper setting affects how the energy is stored and released, therefore affecting the behaviour of the car when it is loaded

Spring settings affects the amount of spring movements and space available while the shock absorber control the effective speed of these movements, therefore how the energy is stored and released

Bump settings control how quickly the suspension springs gets compressed when driving, therefore controlling how the energy is collected or stored

Rebound settings control how quickly the suspension springs gets decompressed to original state when driving, therefore controlling how the energy is used or released

Both of these elements also have fast settings or fast bump or fast rebound

Slow dampers settings affects how the damper behaves under normal circumstances with slow suspension movements such as acceleration braking and cornering.

Fast Damper setting affects how the damper behaves under fast circumstances such as riding kerbs, bumps and fast suspension movements

### Summary 
- Bump and rebound control the spring speed during the slow suspension movements during normal driving
- Fast Bump and fast rebound control the spring speed during fast suspension movements during kerb, bump riding 

#### Key points for dampers
1. Increasing the number has the effect of increasing the resistance of the spring and therefore slowing down the compression and decompression
2. Decreasing this has the effect of decreasing the resistance or less resistance of the spring and therefore increases the speed of compression and decompression 
3. slow compression and decompression with more resistance is stiffening the spring
4. fast compression and decompression with less resistance is softening the spring
5. All this means, damper adjustments controls the speed of the weight transfer in the car
6. Slow and fast rebound setting should always be atleast as high if not higher than my slow and fast bump settings
	1. the reason for this is compression is always need to be stiffer  than the decomression
7. Generally, as i increase the bump and rebound settings the suspension becomes stiffer
	1. if i want my car to bounce around less and be more edgy  under braking and during regular cornering, try increasing the regular bump and rebound setting
	2. if i want my car to bounce around less over kerbs and bumps, increase my fast bump and fast rebound settings
	3. if the car is more snappy or on edge to the corner under braking, try lowering the regular bump and rebound
	4. if the car is more snappy on kerbs or bumps, try lowering the fast bumps and rebounds
8. Use Damper histogram within the motec i2 software to analyse the damper behaviour over every bump, this allows me fine tune everything
